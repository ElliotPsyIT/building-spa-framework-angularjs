Mark Zamoyta's Pluralisight Course Code

Built this frontend code along with the pluralsight course video to reinforce an understanding of the coding principle.

Used Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as the IDE (note: M. Zamoyta uses Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition)

The course builds three widget types, but because of the similarities (just some content and css differences) I built only the temperature widget.  Also, the course adds gulp as a build process, which I did not implement.  Otherwise, this code captures the completed framework pattern with menua and dashboard system within a responsive design, as designed and implement by M. Zamoyta during this course.
