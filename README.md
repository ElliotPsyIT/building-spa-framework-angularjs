# building-spa-framework-angularjs
Mark Zamoyta's Pluralisight Course Code

# Origin
Built this frontend code following along the pluralsight course video entitled "Building a SPA Framework Using AngularJS".  Completed July, 2015.

# Tooling
Used Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as the IDE (note: M. Zamoyta uses Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition)

# Other Notes
Built the code on branch entitled 'spaFramework'.  The master branch contains only this READ.me file.

The course builds three widget types, but because of the similarities (just some content and css differences) I built only the temperature widget.  

Also, the course adds gulp as a build process, which I did not implement in this project.  

And, the course contained a variety of images, some of which I substitued with image I found handy.  Some images I didn't take the trouble to substitute and therefore show as empty in the application.

Otherwise, this code captures the completed framework pattern with menus and dashboard system within a responsive design, as architected and implemented by M. Zamoyta during this course.
