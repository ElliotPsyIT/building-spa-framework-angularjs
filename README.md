# building-spa-framework-angularjs
Mark Zamoyta's Pluralisight Course Code

Built this frontend code following along the pluralsight course video entitle "Building a SPA Framework Using AngularJS".

Used Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as the IDE (note: M. Zamoyta uses Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition)

Angularjs and a variety of 3rd party modules are used.  See index.html for the listing.  There was no package.json file composed for this course, and so these javascript vendor files will need to be downloaded and added to the project, as was done in the video.

The course builds three widget types, but because of the similarities (just some content and css differences) I built only the temperature widget.  Also, the course adds gulp as a build process, which I did not implement.  Otherwise, this code captures the completed framework pattern with menua and dashboard system within a responsive design, as designed and implement by M. Zamoyta during this course.
